    "\n",
    "We have already learned that a digital (grayscale) image is represented as a 2D array of pixel values. In this exercise, we will explore how to load an image and access its pixel values using OpenCV, a powerful library for image processing and computer vision, optimized for real-time applications. Although OpenCV is written in C++, it provides Python bindings for ease of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "A grayscale image is stored as a 2D array of intensity values, where the total number of values is equal to the number of pixels (height $h$ × width $w$). In contrast, a color image is represented as a 3D array with pixel values across multiple channels—for example, an RGB image contains three times as many values as a grayscale image (one set for each color channel: Red, Green, and Blue).\n",
    "\n",
    "The suitable data structure for handling image data in Python is a NumPy array. In fact, most image processing libraries in Python either use NumPy arrays directly or provide functions to convert images into this format. This makes it easy to combine different libraries when working with images.\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize an image, we can use the [`imshow()`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.html) function from matplotlib.\n",

    "1. Read the image `\"../data/images/kingfisher-gray.jpg\"` using `cv.imread()`. See [this example](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/db/deb/tutorial_display_image.html) for reference.  \n",
    "2. Examine the returned array: What is its shape? What is its data type?  \n",

    "This equalized image has a more uniform histogram, which means that the pixel values are more evenly distributed. The CDF is also more linear. All this indicates that the contrast of the image has been improved. On the other hand, the equalization may also amplify the noise or other distortions in the image. For instance, the quantization bands in the original image are more pronounced in the equalized image.\n",
