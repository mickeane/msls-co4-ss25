    "  (with flags `cv.THRESH_BINARY + cv.THRESH_OTSU`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thresholding segments pixels into foreground and background based on their intensity values, making it a form of *binary* segmentation*.

    "## **Method 3: Watershed algorithm for segmentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The watershed algorithm is a powerful tool for image segmentation, particularly useful for separating complex or overlapping structures. It is based on the concept of watershed lines, which define boundaries between different regions in an image. The algorithm works by conceptually \"flooding\" the image from predefined seed points. As water spreads from each seed region, it continues flowing until it meets water from a neighboring region.  \n",
    "The boundaries where the regions meet are defined as the watershed lines, effectively separating the regions. Watershed segmentation can be applied based on pixel intensity or color and is especially effective for images with intricate shapes and touching objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset has structural similarities to the image used in this [OpenCV watershed tutorial](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d3/db4/tutorial_py_watershed.html). We will now follow a simplified version of the tutorial to segment our images using the watershed method. The tutorial uses the following strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overview / Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert the image to a binary mask using thresholding.\n",
    "2. Apply morphological operations to reduce noise and help separate objects. These operations are also used to identify regions that likely represent the background.\n",
    "3. Identify seed points for the watershed algorithm:\n",
    "   - Apply the distance transform to the binary mask. This computes, for each pixel, the distance to the nearest background pixel (value 0).\n",
    "   - Threshold the distance-transformed image to isolate blobs near the centers of objects of interest.\n",
    "   - Use the connected components algorithm to label and enumerate the seed regions, creating a labeled mask.\n",
    "   - Mark the background seed region (identified in step 2) with label `0`.\n",
    "4. Apply the watershed algorithm to segment the regions.\n",
    "5. Visualize the resulting segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Note: Morphological operations**\n",
    "\n",
    "Morphological operations are a set of operations used to analyze and manipulate the shape of objects in an image. Although they are defined for various image types, they are most commonly applied to binary images. These operations involve a structuring element (kernel) that probes the image and modifies pixel values based on the interaction between the kernel and the image. The most common operations include dilation (expands shapes), erosion (shrinks shapes), opening (erosion followed by dilation), and closing (dilation followed by erosion). Morphological operations are useful for removing noise, separating objects, and connecting disjoint regions in an image. There is a separate notebook on morphological operations.\n",

    "### **Note: Distance transform**\n",
    "The distance transform is useful for various image processing tasks. It computes the distance from each pixel to the nearest boundary (i.e., the closest background pixel) in a binary image. Distance transforms are used for operations like skeletonization, shape analysis, and segmentation. The algorithm propagates distance values from boundary pixels inward, typically using a metric such as the Euclidean distance. It is computationally efficient and widely available in image processing libraries.\n",

    "Connected components are regions in a binary image where pixels are connected based on predefined neighborhood rules (e.g., 4-connectivity or 8-connectivity). This technique is used to identify individual objects in a segmentation mask. The algorithm labels each connected region with a unique integer value, allowing for further analysis such as counting or measuring properties of each component.\n",
